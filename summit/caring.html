      <p>Taking care of your Alaskan Husky involves regularly maintaining their coat to prevent knots and tangles. Ensure their ears stay clean and brush their fur frequently.</p>
      
      <p>Engage in daily exercises like walks, runs, and play to satisfy their high energy levels. Use positive reinforcement for training and maintain consistency.</p>
      
      <p>Provide a balanced diet with omega-3 fatty acids for best health. Understand their pack mentality and socialize them early to boost confidence.</p>
      
      <p>Create a husky-friendly environment indoors and outdoors, with toys for stimulation and a secure play area. Consider seasonal care, like extra grooming in winter and providing shade in summer. Prioritize their well-being and companionship.</p>
